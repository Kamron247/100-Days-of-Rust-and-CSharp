# Learning something new cause why not: Rust!
The plan? Learn Rust through the [Rust coding guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
Progress: I got about half way through it when I realized I was no longer interested. 
Why did I stop?: Superficially, cause no jobs looking for a rust dev, Secondly I was getting annoyed by the language, and lastly there was some drama going on with it that made me just want to stay away
