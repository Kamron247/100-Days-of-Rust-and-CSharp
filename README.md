# Learning something new cause why not: Rust!
- The plan: Learn Rust through the [Rust coding guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- Progress: I got about half way through it when I realized I was no longer interested. 
- Why did I stop?:  
  - Superficially, cause no jobs looking for a rust dev
  - Secondly I was getting annoyed by the language and wanted to learn something that would be more relevant to me
  - Lastly there was some drama going on with it that made me just want to stay away
